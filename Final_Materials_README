				EECS 214 - Rahimi, Spring 2014



	This folder contains all of the final submission materials for Team Juliett we have created in the implementation of our project.  

	The folder “Juliett_Frontend_Webapp” contains all of the code for the web-based GUI, which includes code written for input information and the calendar output display.  The same folder contains all of the code designed to “link” the front end and the back end.  The linking code is responsible for sending information inputted into the GUI to the back end so it can be processed, and then send the processed information from the back end to the front end for the calendar output.

	The folder “Juliett_Backend” contains all of the code for the processor.  This code is responsible for generating output based on the information passed by the front end.  The processor’s javadoc can also be accessed in this folder.  To view the entire javadoc in the browser, select “index.html” from the javadoc folder (/Juliett_Backend/dist/javadoc/index.html).

	The pdf “Juliett Project Report” further details our project, responsibilities of the front end and the back end, and the design and development of each part.  As indicated in this report, here is a working link to our project: http://juliett-nu.herokuapp.com/
